Hi! I'm Kefan Tang, a third-year Ph.D. student at the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, supervised by [Prof. Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/). Prior to that, I received a B.E. degree in Automation from Dalian Maritime University in 2020. My research interests include Multimodal Information Retrieval, Computer Vision, and Natural Language Processing.
